## What to do?
Miners should create new tree-search algorithms to solve the tasks set by validators. As shown in the figure below, performance of the solver can vary drastically depending on the choice of algorithm.

Miners will be scored according to the following criteria:
- **Score Achievement**: How high the solver can achieve the score.
- **Runtime**: How fast the solver can solve the task.
- **Memory Usage**: How much memory the solver uses.
